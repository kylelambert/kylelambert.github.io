            <p3>First of all, thank you for visiting my website. This is an ever-evolving personal project
                that I started shortly after graduating college. My goal was to create a digital portfolio
                for all my work both programming and creating art. I was also able to brush up on my 
                basic web development skills.
            </p3>    
            <p3>With this project I wanted to keep things as simple as possible while still providing a robust
                and visually-appealing user experience. As such, almost everything on this site is made with
                pure HTML and CSS, alongside a very small amount of JavaScript functionality for the image slideshows.
            </p3>
            <p3>The site has an optimized design for both desktop and mobile users, so the experience should be universally
                engaging. You can also change between a light and dark theme for all pages using the button at the bottom
                of the page. 
            </p3>
            <p3>This project is hosted on GitHub Pages, so both the site and all of the code is open for anyone to see. 
                Hooray for free hosting and cheap domain names. 
            </p3>
