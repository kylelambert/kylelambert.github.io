            <p1>I'm a software developer and hobby artist from Columbus, Ohio.</p1>
            <p2>Welcome to my website. Here I've highlighted some of my favorite projects and work experiences both in and
                out of college.
            </p2>
            <p2>But first, some more about me. Studying computer science & engineering, I earned my bachelor's degree from 
                The Ohio State University. In Autumn 2019 I graduated with honors with a specialization in computer graphics and
                game design. However, over the course of my college career, I studied a wide range of 
                topics relating to software engineering and development.
            </p2>
            <p2>Currently, I work at Magnanni developing and designing business-facing data analysis tools using both SQL
                and Qlik Sense. I work with databases to provide automated and intuitive information regarding product 
                sales and business partners.
