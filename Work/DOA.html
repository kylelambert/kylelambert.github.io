            <p3>This game was developed throughout my Autumn 2019 semseter at Ohio State as part of the 
                capstone design requirements for my CSE degree. Designed alongside three classmates, 
                Dungeons of Avarice provided a challenge in trying to create a fully-featured game in
                about three months using the Unity engine. At the end of the semester, our team won the
                "Best Game" award as well as the "Most Polished Game" award as voted on by our peers. 
            </p3>    
            <p3>The game offers a unique experience in the roguelike genre, featuring a robust
                co-op mode which allows two players to explore and survive simulatenously. Players can 
                face enemies using a variety of melee- and magic-focused combat items. Because levels are 
                prodcedurally generated, every play-through will provide a new experience.
            </p3>
            <p3>Below you can read about the development process and design decisions made throughout the
                semester. I've also included videos, images, and other diagrams to showcase the tech we 
                used in bringing Dungeons of Avarice to life. Without further ado, here is our final trailer
                for the game.
