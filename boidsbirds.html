            <p3>This project, developed alongside Anthony Bartholomew, was the main focus of the 
                Real-Time Rendering course at The Ohio State University. We choose to study Boids 
                algorithm, which simulates the flocking or swimming patterns of birds or fish. We wanted
                to recreate these complex behaviors observed in nature while providing interactivity to users.
                We also wanted to keep computational complexity low while emulating this realistic movements.
            </p3>    
            <p3>This project makes use of low-level WebGL 2.0, which  uses HTML and Javascript, to create a 2D implementation 
                of the Boids algorithm. WebVR is incorporated into the design to allow for a user to view the flock in virtual 
                reality. The project is viewable on any Android device through the Chrome web browser, allowing for use of 
                Google Cardboard or any other mobile VR headset. Users can add more birds to the scene by clicking anywhere 
                or touching the screen.
            </p3>
            <p3>Flocking is the act of boids, or animals in this case, congregating together in a massive group 
                as they move from one place to another. This behavior can be observed in animals such as birds. 
                As birds are flying, they generally tend to move in the direction of other birds, thus forming large 
                groups together. When birds are in these groups, they try to avoid crashing into one another, head 
                in the same direction as the group, or break off and form smaller groups with other birds. Finding 
                ways to improve algorithm performance and simulate realistic behaviors are both important to the 
                future of the field of computer graphics.
            </p3>
            <p3>Boids algorithm is able to replicate flocking behavior using three key principles, which are cohesion, 
                separation, and alignment. Cohesion is the ability for boids to find the average position of its 
                relative neighbors for the purposes of staying together with the group. Separation is the ability for 
                the boids to find the average distance between itself and its neighbors so that it can avoid colliding 
                into other boids. Finally, alignment is the ability for the boids to find the average direction of its 
                neighbors so that it can fix its orientation and move in the same direction of the group.
            </p3>
            <p3>Another goal was to provide both a virtual reality and non-virtual reality experience. As such, 
                we researched how to map the scene to a cylinder around the viewer. 
                After researching and implementing the Boid algorithm, we wanted to find ways to improve 
                its performance as more objects are added to the environment. When determining the effects 
                of cohesion, separation, and alignment, some calculations were repeated for each boid in the scene. 
                We found that by computing this information only once, performance could be improved significantly. 
                Adding more boids to the scene allows for larger flocks of birds, leading to a more interesting experience for users. 
            </p3>
            <p3>After finishing the initial implementation, we decided to theme both the birds and clouds after 
                the 1984 Nintendo Entertainment System game "Duck Hunt". This required a custom animation system that utilized 
                a texture atlas to switch between frames and animation sets. This system changes based upon the heading 
                of the velocity vector. The heading determines the direction the bird is facing, which in turn determines 
                which animation set to use.                 
            </p3>
            <p3>When the program is not in VR mode, the boids, or ducks, are draw onto the xy-plane. As a boid approaches 
                the edge of the screen, it will fly out of view for a short distance and then wrap around the plane to the 
                opposite side. We also included clouds to fill in the background in order to make it make it look more sky-like. 
                When the program is in VR mode, then the boids will have their planar positions mapped to a cylindrical plane 
                that is centered at the origin. Additionally, the user will be placed at the origin of the scene so that they 
                are inside of the cylindrical plane.
            </p3>
            <p3>As the program is running on a mobile device, the user can physically move their head in the world to see 
                how the boids are interacting with each other, which drastically increases the level of immersion for the user. 
                One important note about mobile devices is that iOS devices cannot run the program properly since WebGL 2.0 
                features are currently considered as experimental/developer only options.
            </p3>
            <p3>In terms of performance, the team tested the number of frames per second output as the number of bird objects 
                in the scene were increased. These tests were performed for both the VR and non-VR scenes. Clouds were also 
                removed from this test as the differences were negligible.
            </p3>
            <p3>The program maintains the maximum amount of performance at 60 fps up until around 225 birds. At his point, 
                performance in both viewing modes starts to drop nearly linearly. There are a few dips which can be explained 
                by changes in the amount of boids within a certain searching range of each other. The number of these 
                calculations vary depending on the positions of each boid in the environment. Once reaching 500 boids, 
                performance had dipped to less than 20 fps in both modes. The performance in virtual reality is very slightly 
                worse as compared to non-VR. This is likely due to rendering the scene twice, once for each eye. Performance 
                will also likely vary depending of the hardware used. These performance tests were done using a laptop with an 
                Intel Core i7 2.80 GHz processor, 16GB DDR4 RAM, and a GeForce GTX 1060 with 6GB VRAM. 
            </p3>
            <p3>Overall, I'd say we gained experience in visualizing realistic behavior of birds using the famous Boids 
                algorithm, insight into how to use low-level WebGL, and how to integrate WebVR into a WebGL application.
