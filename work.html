            <p1>Dungeons of Avarice</p1>
            <p2>A procedurally-generated roguelike video game developed in the Unity game engine. The game supports
                one or two players simultaneously and features endless dungeons with increasing difficulty.
                Face various enemies while collecting over 60 unique melee weapons and 12 types of magic spells. This 
                project was developed alongside three classmates at The Ohio State University as part 
                of our department's senior capstone design program.

            <p1>Boids Birds Algorithm</p1>
            <p2>A WebGL and JavaScript project implementation of Boids algorithm, which simulates the flocking or
                swimming patterns of birds or fish. A simple 2D animation system is used to display the art of birds
                from the NES classic "Duck Hunt". The project also utilizes WebVR to wrap the birds around the user in a
                3D space provided they use a supported mobile device, Virtual Reality headset, and web browser.

            <p2>Created from the ground up in C++, this console-based game is heavily inspired
                by text adventures from the 1970s and 80s, such as Zork. This project acts as a framework for
                setting up dungeons to explore and puzzles to solve. It also includes three example
                adventures for players to experience.

            <p2>A collection of four projects written in WebGL and Javascript with the help of the THREE.js library.
                These projects focused on the fundamentals of graphics rendering, using math to create and display 
                various shapes or objects. There is also an L-Systems project to display a branching pattern that users can manipulate.
