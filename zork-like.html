            <p3>Created from the ground up in exclusively C++, this console-based game is heavily inspired by text adventures 
                from the 1970s and 80s, such as Zork. This project acts as a framework for setting up dungeons to 
                explore and puzzles to solve. It also includes three example adventures for players to experience.
                This project was a group effort designed and implemented by myself, Dan Greer, and Anthony Bartholomew.
            </p3>    
            <p3>Zork, a game based on an environment described entirely through text with user commands, was one 
                of the earliest interactive computer games, inspiring dozens of similar games and starting the adventure 
                video game genre.  We wanted to create a similar action-adventure experience using the console using C++.  
                The console will display information about the environment, items in the room, inventory, 
                story, and user commands, allowing the user to undertake a variety of actions and immerse themselves in the world.  
                The game is played for fun, allowing the user to explore as much as they like, with slight competition as a 
                timer running in the background will allow them to see how long it took them to solve the various puzzles, 
                incentivizing them to play again and attempt to beat their time.
            </p3>
            <p3>There are three paths to choose from at the start, and the player can play until reaching the end of the 
                chosen path. A timer is used to measure how long it takes the player to beat the game. Your time is shown to you 
                after finishing the chosen path. 
            </p3>
